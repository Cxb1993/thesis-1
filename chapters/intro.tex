The dynamics of liquid-gas interfacial flows play a critical role in several processes in nature, 
as well as in myriad industrial applications. 
The key elements of surface tension dominated flows such as droplets and bubbles constitute the  
fundamental mechanisms governing the exchange of heat and mass at the ocean-atmosphere interface \cite{seinfeld1998air,deike}, 
mixing/separation in context of metallurgical processes \cite{johansen1988fluid,metal},  
conventional modes of heat transfer \cite{deckwer1980mechanism,bubble}
and ever so importantly, the tranmission of pathogens \cite{lydia_1,lydia_2}. 
One of the most fascinating features of multiphase flows is the process of atomization, 
in which a liquid volume transitions into smaller fragments via a series of topological 
changes of varying complexity, ultimately resulting in the emergence of drops of various sizes
driven by the action of capillary forces at the interface separating the fluids.  
Such processes are ubiquitous in a diverse range of applications spanning from combustion related processes 
(\cite{lefebvre2017atomization,bayvel1993liquid}) to agricultural irrigation (\cite{lake1977effect,reichenberger2007mitigation}).
