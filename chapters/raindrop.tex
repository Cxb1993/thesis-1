\chapter{Artificial Atomization : The Falling Raindrop}
\labch{raindrop}

In this chapter we take a closer look at the issues 
plaguing numerical methods that try to deal with flows 
entailing significant contrasts between the material 
properties of the two fluids. Arguably, the most common
instances of such flows are those involving the interaction
between air and water, primarily in the form of droplets and 
bubbles that play important roles in both natural and industrial processes. 
As for the numerical platform, we use `PARIS Simulator' 
\sidenote{Refer to \cite{paris} for a detailed exposition  
of the numerical methods implemented in `PARIS Simulator.} 
to carry out our simulations on this topic. 
A flow configuration that combines the complexities of large 
density-ratios with the interaction between capillary, viscous and 
inertial stresses is that of a water droplet falling in the 
air under the influence of gravitational acceleration.
The contents of the chapter are primarily derived 
from the recent investigations of the falling raindrop  
in Fuster et al. \sidecite{caf_momcons}, in which
the author is a primary contributor.

\section{Problem Setup}

The problem is characterized by a combination of Reynolds, 
Weber and Bond numbers, the definitions of which are as follows : 

\begin{align}
We=\frac{\rho_{g} U^2 D}{\sigma} \quad,\quad Re= \frac{\rho_{l} U D}{\mu_{g}} \quad,\quad Bo=\frac{\left(\rho_{l}-\rho_{g}\right) g D^2 }{\sigma}
\end{align}

The subscripts $l$ and $g$ represent liquid and gas phases respectively. 
In our particular numerical setup, $We \simeq 3.2 $, $Re \simeq 1455 $ and $Bo \simeq 1.2 $, 
thus corresponding to that of a $3mm$ diameter raindrop (a relatively large one) 
falling in the air at an approximate terminal velocity of  
$8$ m/s (interpolated from empirical data, refer to Gunn and Kinzer \cite{gunn1949}). 
The parameters in the problem setup are given in Table \ref{raindropprop}, 
and the schematic diagram given in Fig. \ref{setup}. 
The droplet is initially placed at the center of a cubic domain (3D), 
whose side is 4 times the diameter of the drop.

In order to properly reproduce and analyse the dynamics 
of a relatively large drop (high Reynolds flow) such as in our case, 
the numerical method has to accurately resolve the thin boundary layers, 
the interaction of such layers with the capillary forces and finally 
the non-linear feedback of the complex 
3D vortical structures present in the wake behind the droplet. 
Such an undertaking was attempted by Dodd and Ferrante \cite{dodd2014}, 
in which they managed to delineate the different regimes concerning the 
behavior of the wake behind the droplet, although at relatively 
lower Reynolds numbers (the maximum Reynolds tested was $\simeq 500$, 
whereas in our case it is $\simeq 1500$).    
Therefore, our objective behind the demonstration of this particular 
test case is \textit{not} to develop a high fidelity model of a raindrop, 
but rather carry out a stringent evaluation of the robustness of our numerical 
method compared to ones that are not mass-momentum consistent. 
For such a low Weber number the capillary forces dominate and the 
droplet should remain intact, and definitely not undergo any subsequent atomization.

\section{Numerical Instabilities}

Numerical simulations of this test case at moderate resolution 
(from $D/h=16$ to $D/h=64$) carried out \textit{without} the 
consistent scheme described in this paper results in the catastrophic 
deformations of the droplet as illustrated in Fig. \ref{cata}, 
which we describe as `fictitious' or `artificial' atomization. 
We propose the following explanation in order to account for such numerical artifacts. 
To start with, we neglect gravity and viscous effects at this relatively large Reynolds number. 
Also, we are interested in steady-state flow. 
On the axis and near the hyperbolic stagnation point 
at the front of the droplet one has $u_2=0$ for the transverse 
(radial) velocity and for the axial momentum balance


\begin{align}
u_1 \partial_1 u_1 = - \frac 1 \rho \partial_1 p.
\end{align}

Due to the large viscosity and density ratios, it is not possible for 
the air flow to immediately entrain the water, so the fluid velocity 
is significantly smaller inside the droplet. 
In the air the acceleration near the stagnation point is 
of the order $U^2/D$, whereas the pressure gradient is

\begin{align}
\partial_1 p \sim \rho_{g} U^2/D.
\end{align}
The pressure gradient in the water is much smaller, 
however, in the case of a mixed cell the water density 
multiplies the air acceleration $U^2/D$, so that

\begin{align}
\partial_1 p \sim \rho_{l} U^2/D,
\end{align}

then a large pressure gradient results in the mixed cell or cells. 
This large pressure gradient results in a large pressure inside the 
droplet near the front stagnation point, as shown in Figure \ref{pressure_1}. 
This large pressure is balanced by surface tension only for a sufficiently 
large curvature near the droplet front. 
This explains the presence of a ``dimple'' often observed in low 
resolution simulations of the falling drop. 
This artifact had been observed by Xiao \cite{xiao2012} in a similar case 
involving the sudden interaction of a droplet at rest with a uniform gas flow. 
The resulting large un-physical pressure gradients across the interface 
eventually lead to its rapid destabilization and concomitant breakup.

\end{figure*}


Visualization of the flow around the droplets (Figure \ref{flow_field}) 
illustrates the challenging nature of the flow configuration, 
even for such a seemingly simple physical problem. 
As one can observe, the boundary layers are extremely thin. 
Therefore, even though the velocity field is continuous across the 
interface (in the discrete sense) in the absence of mass transfer, 
there is the appearance of strong velocity variations at the 
scale of the grid size for such coarse levels of grid refinement. 
We observe that applying the numerical method described in this 
paper brings a considerable and systematic improvement over a 
spectrum of different flux limiters (WENO, ENO, Superbee, QUICK, Verstappen) 
and CFL numbers, as evidenced by comparing the figures \ref{pressure_1} and \ref{pressure_2}.

non-consistent method (top row) and the present method (bottom row),

The red contour indicates the isosurface of the volume fraction 
field corresponding to a value of $0.5$, whereas the black contours 
surrounding the drop represent isosurfaces of the magnitude of vorticity. 
The raindrop with the non-consistent method displays massive deformations 
leading to artificial breakup as a result of rapidly growing numerical instabilities. 
The droplet resolution for both methods is $D/h = 16$ .}

\section{Effect of Mass-Momentum Consistent Transport}

To summarize, the simulations broadly fall into three categories. 
The first two categories concern those that use the present 
mass-momentum consistent method, and as a result maintain 
physical values of the kinetic energy and smooth interface shapes. 
Certain simulations amongst the ones carried out with the present 
method display some numerical instabilities (but not leading 
to catastrophic deformation) as a function of the choice of 
advection scheme (CIAM/WY) and 
flux limiter (QUICK/WENO/ENO/Superbee/Verstappen) combination. 

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 1.5\textwidth]{plots/raindrop/multiplot_raindrop.png}

\vspace*{-0.5cm}
\caption{Temporal evolution of quantities of interest to evaluate the 
performance of our present method for different spatial resolutions.

(b) Moment of inertia of the droplet along the flow (X) direction. 
(c) and (d) Moment of inertia of the droplet along the directions 
perpendicular to flow (Y,Z), evolution of $I_{yy}$ 
seems to be more or less identical to $I_{zz}$.}
\label{multi}
\end{figure*}

Finally, there are simulations carried out with the standard 
non-consistent method that rapidly blow up, displaying marked peaks 
or spikes in kinetic energy as a function of time, 
associated with massively deformed interface shapes (see figure \ref{explode_compare}). 
Therefore, our studies suggest that certain combinations 
of the advection scheme and the flux limiter are 
numerically more robust than others, in particular, the most stable combinations 
are that of CIAM advection with 
Superbee limiter and the WY advection with QUICK limiter. 
As a minor remark, the CIAM advection with the Superbee limiter appear to be quite diffusive.

\caption{Relative change in the mass of the droplet 
as a function of time in plots (a), (b) and (c). 
The simulations are carried out with a resolution of $D/h = 16$, 
for a total time of $0.1$ milliseconds. 
The symbol ``WY'' in the legend corresponds to those run using 
the Weymouth-Yue advection scheme in combination with the QUICK limiter, 
and ``CIAM'' corresponds to the CIAM scheme in combination with the Superbee limiter. 
(a) The dependence of the mass conservation properties of

For the WY-QUICK combination, using a stricter tolerance results 
in better mass conservation, whereas the conservation properties of the 
CIAM-Superbee combination seems to be independent of the tolerance.
(b) Dependence of the mass conservation on the clipping parameter employed. 
The CIAM-Superbee combination again seems to be impervious to changes in clipping, 
whereas WY-QUICK seems to perform slightly better by lowering the parameter.

The WY-QUICK combination displays better results for all except the lowest resolution.

\label{mass_conv}
\end{figure*}

We illustrate the performance of the present method through the 
results of our simulations in Figure \ref{multi}. 
The spatial resolutions correspond to $D/h = 8, 16, 32 $ and $64$ 
using the WY advection scheme in combination with the QUICK flux limiter, 
while keeping the same value for the inflow velocity boundary condition. 
The quantities of interest while examining the robustness of the 
method are the temporal evolution of the droplet kinetic energy 
(Fig. \ref{multi}. (a) ) and the moment of inertia of the droplet 
along the three directions (Fig. \ref{multi}. (b),(c),(d)) . 
The inflow is along the X direction with gravity opposite to it. 
The moment of inertia is used as a descriptor of the 'average' droplet shape, 
with the three moments of inertia along the different axes $I_m$ defined as - 


\begin{align}
	I_m = \int_{\mathcal{D}} H x_m^2 d \boldsymbol{x} \quad , \quad \text{where}, \quad 1 \le m \le 3
\end{align}

where $\mathcal{D}$ is the computational domain and $x_m$ is the 
distance of the interface relative to the center of mass of the droplet.   
The kinetic energy of the droplet evolves in a relatively smooth manner, 
without the presence of sudden spikes and falls which are emblematic of 
the standard non-consistent version of our method (refer to Fig. \ref{pressure_2}). 
Such abrupt changes in kinetic energy of the droplet have been 
found to be associated with instants when the droplet undergoes 
`artificial' atomization or breakup, henceforth resulting in 
the catastrophic loss of stability for the numerical method. 
We observe a systematic drop in the amount of the droplet 
kinetic energy as we increase resolution, with the most probable explanation 
being that of the suppression of spurious interfacial 
oscillations which are rampant at low resolutions. 
There is also a component of the kinetic energy of the droplet 
associated with the internal coherent vortical structures generated due to 
the interaction of aerodynamic shear at the interface, 
evidenced by the non-zero value of the kinetic 
energy even for the most highly resolved droplets. 
Finally, the moment of inertia of the droplet appears to evolve 
in a smooth manner for all droplet resolutions, with higher 
resolutions exhibiting lower amounts of inertia as a result of 
the more compact shapes obtained once the 
spurious interfacial deformation modes are subdued. 
This observation holds true for the moment of inertia curves regardless of direction.           


We have to keep in mind that the velocity inflow condition 
does not correspond to the `exact' teminal velocity 
field an actual falling raindrop might experience, 
hence the droplet in our numerical setup does have some 
finite acceleration due to the imbalance 
between the aerodynamic forces and gravity. 
In Figure \ref{drop_vel}, we demonstrate the velocity of 
the center of mass of the droplet (in the frame of reference 
of the box enclosing the droplet) as a function of time, 
and its behavior as we increase the droplet resolution. 
As one can observe, due to the imbalance of forces acting on the droplet, 
it undergoes a net acceleration as evidenced by the approximately 
linear increase (absolute value) in the velocity as a function of time. 
The temporal variation in the droplet velocity is fitted to a 
linear polynomial in order to evaluate the droplet acceleration 
by means of a standard least-squares approach, for each droplet resolution. 
We illustrate (inset Figure \ref{drop_vel}) that we achieve more 
accurate fits as a consequence of higher droplet resolutions, 
as evidenced by a decrease in the standard error on the fits 
ranging from $\pm 11.1 \%$ for $D/h = 8$ to a value of $\pm 0.12 \%$ 
for the highest resolution of $D/h = 64$. 
The results obtained in this section indicate that especially 
when it comes to low resolutions, 
our numerical method can be used to get relatively good 
estimates of the underlying flow features of the droplet 
without observing an un-physical evolution as a consequence of discretization errors.
