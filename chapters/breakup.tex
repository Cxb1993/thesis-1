\chapter{Droplet Generation in Corrugated Ligaments}
\labch{breakup}

% Rearrangement of liquid volumes in ligaments
Ligaments constitute the penultimate stage in the complex sequence 
of capillary-driven topological changes that are 
typical of liquid fragmentation processes, 
finally resulting in the generation of polydisperse collections of drops. 
In the context of the present body of work, we shall 
only concern ourselves with the dynamics of Newtonian ligaments, 
which are well described by the Navier-Stokes equations 
at the incompressible and isothermal limits. 
The rearrangement of the liquid volumes that constitute
the ligaments play a key role in determining the size 
of the droplets that emerge immediately after the disintegration
of the thread-like structure (Fig. \ref{lig_stretch} ).

	inside the ligament plays a key role in its subsequent 
	disintegration into droplet of various sizes. 
	}
\label{lig_stretch}
\end{marginfigure}

The dynamics of these rearrangements prior to breakup are 
governed by non-linear interactions between several 
physical mechanisms such as the growth and propagation of capillary 
waves along the ligament surface, remnants of the internal flow, 
stretching induced either by the surrounding gas flow or by 
acceleration of the liquid into the surrounding medium itself,
not to mention the dissipative effects of viscosity.  
Although we present a convoluted picture of ligament dynamics prior
to breakup, it is ultimately the capillary force that drives the 
eventual topology change from the thread-like structure to that of the drop. 
The primary role of the both the inertial and viscous forces is to oppose 
or dampen the destabilizing effects of the capillarity induced deformations.   
An additional mechanism to consider is the merger or coalescence of the 
newly created droplets (post-breakup) along the axis of the former ligament
structure, or with droplets originating from other sources in the near vicinity. 
The generation of drops whose diameters are significantly larger than the 
width of original ligament are predominantly driven by the aforementioned coalescences.  
Therefore, considering the combined effects of the above mechanisms, we expect a significant
departure of the resulting drop size distribution from that predicted by the  
classical analysis of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability \cite{rayleigh1879a,rayleigh1879b}. 


% Corrugation-coalescence model
\section{Coalescence Cascade}

Linear theory based on the Rayleigh breakup of infinitely
long liquid cylinders in a quiescent medium predicts the disintegration
of the thread along regular intervals, the length of which is governed
by the fastest growing spatial frequency. 
The drops generated according to this model would be uniform in
size, in sharp contrast to the significant variances in the size distributions
observed in reality.  
Even in the simpler case of decaying liquid jets, 
non-linearities near the breakup zone kick into effect beyond
the initial exponential growth phase predicted by linear theory, 
eventually resulting in the jet breaking up into 
``main'' drops and significantly smaller ``satellite'' droplets 
\sidenote{Refer to the high quality photographs in 
the work of Rutland and Jameson \cite{rutland1971non}, where they demonstrate 
the formation of ``satellite'' droplets that manifest due to the non-linear effects
driving the jet breakup.}. 
Thus, simply taking into account the non-linear effects driving the breakup would
lead to a bimodal distribution of droplet size, but this explanation 
still fails to account for the broad distribution of sizes observed in 
the outcomes of the majority of natural \cite{nature} and industrial \cite{industrial} processes. 


As we have seen in the previous chapter, there are several hypotheses 
in existing literature \sidecite{vill_1} 
that attempt to model the underlying physical mechanisms 
that are responsible for the selection of droplet size. 
A model first proposed by Villermaux and coworkers \sidecite{vill_2,vill_4}
asserts that the variance in the droplet sizes is strongly 
correlated to the initially corrugated shape of the 
ligament, from which the drops originate. 
In this model, the corrugated ligament is represented as a collection 
of `blobs' (see Fig. \ref{blobs}), with the continuous interaction between 
such blobs throughout the destabilization phase accounting for the 
rearrangement and concomitant aggregation of the liquid volumes prior to breakup. 
\marginnote{
The corrugation-coalescence mechanisn has been 
popularized in several studies such as \cite{vill_3,vill_1,vill_5,vill_6,vill_7},
and more recently in \cite{bonn,mckinley}.
}
The key parameter concerning the predictions of this model 
is $n$, which characterizes the corrugations in the initial 
geometrical shape of the ligament, defined as  

\begin{align}
	n \equiv \frac{1}{\left(\langle d^{2} \rangle - \langle d \rangle^{2} \right) / \langle d \rangle^{2}} \, ,  
\end{align}

\begin{marginfigure}
\centering
\includegraphics{plots/ligament_breakup/lig_protoblobs.png}
\caption{Representation of the liquid volumes in an isolated ligament as `blobs'
	of sizes $d$ matching the corresponding the local thicknesses,

	}
\label{blobs}
\end{marginfigure}


where the quantities in the brackets $\langle \quad \rangle$ represent the mean
and the diameters $d_i$ correspond to that of the blobs as shown in Fig. \ref{blobs}.
These studies essentially demonstrate that the degree of polydispersity 
in the drop sizes can be simply explained by examining the 
degree of ``smoothness'' in the initial geometry of the ligaments, 
with the standard deviation or distribution width of the size of the 
emerging drops scaling as $1 / \sqrt{n}$. 
As a corollary to this prediction, a broader distribution of drop sizes arise out
of the disintegration of strongly corrugated (rough) ligaments, whereas smoother 
ligaments with uniform thickness lead to a narrower (monodisperse) distributions.

\label{lig_network}
\end{marginfigure}


% Difficulties associated 
Over the last two decades, a handful of studies have been conducted 
with the aim of carrying out detailed observations surrounding 
the aforementioned ``coalescence cascade'', whereby the drops 
constitutive of the ligament tend to coalesce and form larger drops
as and when they detach from the initial thread-like structure.
Most notable amongst those studies is the one by Marmottant and Villermaux \cite{vill_3},
wherein they illustrate the successive stages of the disintegration of 
liquid ligaments formed when capillary tubes are rapidly retracted from 
the surface of a liquid pool (refer to Fig. \ref{lig_stretch}). 
Another set of observations were presented by Lhuissier and Villermaux \cite{sheet_hole},
where the disintegration phase sets in starting from a transient configuration
of the ligaments arranged in a spider-web like network (Fig. \ref{lig_network}).  
A more recent experiment is that of Keshavarz et al. \cite{mckinley},
which is inspired by the capillary tube retractions of \cite{vill_3} 
but directed towards the behaviour of non-Newtonian fluids.
The fundamental limitation that is common to experiments cited above 
is the inability to precisely control the initial conditions.
In other words, generating ligaments conforming `\textit{exactly}'
to a specified geometrical shape is practically (almost) impossible 
due to the inherent difficulties associated with the control of free-surface flows.  
In the absence of such precise control and reproducibility of the initial 
ligament corrugations, one has to resort to a posteriori correlations between 
the width of the final drop size distributions and qualitative descriptions 
of the initial surface profiles.
A central theme of the current chapter is concerning the design and conception
of `numerical' experiments that lend themselves to accurate and repeatable 
specifications of the initial conditions of the ligaments in question.  
An additional advantage offered by our high-fidelity numerical approach 
is the access to a much wider range (compared to physical experiments) within the 
space of all control parameters that influence the dispersion in the drop size distributions, 
not to mention the higher levels of temporal resolution on offer 
that enable better tracking of the non-linear dynamics near pinch-off
\sidenote{The characteristic time-scale of the flow near the 
vicinity of the breakup is given by $ t_{\sigma} \sim \left(\rho r^3 / \sigma \right)^{1/2} $, thus
leading to faster flows and contraction of the time-scales as the local thickness ($r$) 
decreases to zero. In our numerical methods, we can adaptively select the time
interval over which the integration of the governing equations are carried out, to 
accommodate such non-linearly accelerating flows.}. 
The combination of these two features enables us to quantitatively map the 
influence that the degree of smoothness of the initial ligament has on the ensuing 
liquid rearrangements, as well as the coalescence dynamics following the ligament.

\section{Numerical Setup}
Our numerical experiments entail direct numerical simulations of the two-phase
Navier-Stokes equations, employing the one-fluid model which  
solves only a single set of governing equations throughout the whole domain,
where the domains are composed of regions of variable density and viscosity. 
In order to reproduce the free-surface dynamics, a Volume-of-Fluid 
(VOF) approach is used to capture the interface, the explicit location 
of which marks the separation between the two fluids.

\label{octree}
\end{marginfigure}


A more detailed evaluation of the comparitive advantages of different  
interfacial tracking approaches (e.g. VOF, level set, phase field etc) 
can be found in the comprehensive review by Scardovelli and Zaleski 
\cite{zaleskiannual}, or in a more recent exposition by  
Mirjalili et al. \cite{mirjalili2017interface} on the same topic.
The immiscible nature of the flows under consideration translates to the 
absence of mass tranfer across the interface, thereby rendering the 
velocity field continuous across the interface at the incompressible limit. 
The study is primarily focused on isothermal air-water systems, with 
the material properties corresponding to that at 20 degrees Celcius.

\end{marginfigure}


We solve our set of governing equations using the open-source toolbox 
Basilisk \cite{basilisk}, which couples finite-volume discretization 
on octree meshes (Fig. \ref{octree}) to solve the two-phase 
Navier-Stokes equations with surface tension.
The use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in conjunction with the octree structure
allows an extremely efficient (compared to uniform grids) utilization of 
computational resources especially when dealing with the multiscale nature (see Fig. \ref{amr}) 
of surface tension dominated flows, where the bulk of the computational power
is diverted towards resolving regions in close proximity to the interface location. 
The solver utilizes a robust and accurate implementation 
of the CSF \cite{csf} (Continuum Surface Force) surface tension model 
that governs the volumetric distribution of the capillary forces on the dynamically 
refined grid (refer to \cite{popinet2009accurate} for more details). 
The numerical methods used in Basilisk have been extensively validated
through studies conducted on a variety of free-surface flows, 
recent examples being on the topic of air entrainement through wave breaking
\cite{basilisk_1, basilisk_3}, jets created due to bursting bubbles \cite{basilisk_2, basilisk_5}
modeling of viscoelastic droplet splashes \cite{basilisk_4} and many more.


\subsection*{Computational Schematic}

As discussed in the previous sections, the 
dynamics of the liquid volume rearrangements 
within the ligaments are quite involved 
due to the non-trivial interactions between
the inertial, viscous and capillary effects 
at different length and time scales that span
over several orders of magnitude.
In order to isolate the direct influence of 
initial geometrical shape of the ligament on 
the subsequent dynamics, we have decided to 
exclude the inertial forces \sidenote{
We use inertial forces as an umbrella term
to describe all the forces that might contribute to
the ``stretching'' of the ligament, 
thus opposing the capillary deformations.
These primarily include the remnant flow within
the ligament bulk, the aerodynamic shear at the interface
and the acceleration of the ligament itself into 
the surrounding gas medium. 
}
with respect to the initial conditions. 
Therefore, we opt for a very particular type of setup,
with infinitely long ligaments having zero initial kinetic energy, 
and spatial periodicity in the geometrical shape along the axis. 
We carry out the simulations in an axisymmetric framework, 
therefore excluding any azimuthal variations
in the initial shape as a consequence of this simplification. 
Fig. \ref{schematic} illustrates the a 2D schematic of the
computational setup, where the domain is a square of side $L$. 
The bottom side of the box acts as the axis of symmetry for 
the corrugated ligament (detailed view in the inset of Fig. \ref{schematic}), 
which has an unperturbed (mean) radius $R$. 
Due to the periodicity of the ligaments in the axial direction, 
we impose periodic boundary conditions for the primary variables 
on the left and right faces of the domain.
Symmetry conditions are imposed on the bottom side, 
with impenetrable free-slip conditions applied on the top side.

respectively, which in our case corresponds to an air-water system
with the surface tension coefficient $\sigma$. 
}

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Random Surface Generation}

A key ingredient of this investigation on the impact 
of corrugations is the ability to precisely
control the quantitative aspects of the initial 
corrugated surface profile of the ligament. 
Towards that objective, we construct a surface 
using the superposition of random overlapping waves, 
corresponding to an overall spatial period $L$ of the resulting profile. 
The aspect of ``randomness'' is achieved by  
using a state of the art white noise generation algorithm,
introduced in the seminal work of Matsumoto and Nishimura \sidecite{rng}.
A robust and open source implementation of the aforementioned algorithm 
is available in the GNU Scientific Library toolkit \cite{gnusl},
and thus readily incorporated into our numerical platform Basilisk.   

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{plots/ligament_breakup/profile.pdf}
	\caption{ Radial profile of the noisy and the subsequently 
	low-pass filtered surface of the ligament, corresponding to 
	one spatial period along its axis. 
	Inset : Spectral densities of the initial noisy signal
        and the corresponding filtered signal. Only a handful
	of small wavenumbers are chosen to create the surface. 
}
\label{surface}
\end{figure}

The discretization of the radial profile $R(x)$ is expressed
as some random perturbation added to the mean value   

\begin{align}
R_i = R \left( 1 + \epsilon_i \right) \quad , \quad \epsilon _i = \epsilon_0 \cdot \lambda_i^{\textrm{rng}}, 
\end{align}

where $i$ represents the discretization of the continuous profile along the
axis, $R$ is the mean (unperturbed) radius, 
$\epsilon_0$ is the mean corresponding to the amplitudes
\sidenote{ As pointed out in the inset of Fig. \ref{surface},
the amplitudes of the random waves generated by the random noise
generator are normally distributed. 
}
of the random waves, and finally $\lambda_i^{\textrm{rng}}$ are the set of  
random values between $0$ and $1$ generated by the white noise algorithm.
The sequence of numbers $\lambda_i^{\textrm{rng}}$ is uniquely determined 
by the value of the seed given as input to the white noise generator.
This ensures that there are no unforeseen correlations between any two
ligament surface profiles, with the exact shape of any given ligament  
depending on the value of the seed, the mean amplitude  
of the perturbations and the number of random waves left in the filtered signal. 
It is important to note that the mean amplitude $\epsilon_0$ serves as an indirect 
way to control the dispersion in the initial white noise signal, with a smaller 
mean corresponding to a `narrower' distribution of $\lambda_i^{\textrm{rng}}$. 

The initial noisy surface generated by the white noise algorithm
contains extremely sharp edges corresponding to infinite values of 
interfacial curvature (see Fig. \ref{surface}), which are present due
to the inclusion of perturbations corresponding to large wavenumbers. 
In order to avoid the ``smoothening'' of these edges by our numerical method,   
we remove these high frequency modes \textit{a priori} in a controllable fashion. 
As demonstrated in Fig. \ref{surface}, the noisy surface is treated by a low-pass filter 
in order to obtain the final description of the ligament's radial profile. 


\subsection*{Adimensional Groups}

The initial conditions of the computational setup can be 
characterized by Weber and Ohnesorge numbers, as defined below   

\begin{align}
	We = 0 \quad , \quad Oh = \mu / \sqrt{\rho \sigma R} . 
\end{align}

The Weber number is zero due to the ligaments initially being at rest, 
but during the rapid destabilization phase a part of the surface 
potential is instantly transformed into kinetic energy of the liquid.  
The Ohnesorge number gives us an indication of the scale separation
between the characteristic length scale of the problem ($R$) and 
the viscous length scale ($l_{\mu} = \mu^2 / \rho \sigma $) corresponding 
to the liquid and its free-surface. The geometrical shape of the ligament can 
be characterized by a combination of the corrugation amplitude ($\varepsilon$),
cut-off wavenumber ($K$) and the aspect ratio ($\Lambda$), defined as   

\begin{align}
 \varepsilon = \epsilon_0 / R \quad , \quad K = n_c \cdot \left(2\pi W/ L \right) \quad
	, \quad \Lambda = L / W , 
\end{align}

where $W = 2R$ denotes the mean width of the ligament, with only
the $n_c$ smallest (discrete) wavenumbers passing through the low-pass filter .
The volume of the corrugated ligament per unit spatial period 
is controlled by the aspect ratio, thus indirectly setting the 
upper limit to the size of the largest drop that could thoeretically
form if all the volume of the ligament were to aggregate into a single shape.
As in the case with most surface tension dominated flows, 
the capillary time scale is the most natural choice, which we
use to obtain our non-dimensional time as 

\begin{align}
	T = t \cdot \left(\rho R^3 / \sigma \right)^{-1/2} . 
\end{align}


\subsubsection*{Quantization of Waves}

As a consequence of the discrete nature of space in
the context of numerical simulations, we can inject energy
only into certain spatial frequencies.
In our particular case,
