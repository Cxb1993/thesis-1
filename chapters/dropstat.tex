\section{Monte Carlo Approach}



% interested in long time dynamics as coalescences lead to larger drop sizes


\section{Millimeter Scale Ensembles}

We turn our attention towards slender ligaments whose widths are of the 
order of millimeters, a scale at which a multitude of fragmentation phenomena
\sidenote{Some examples of fragmentation at this length scale involve ligaments
generated by drop splashes on different substrates, secondary atomization of raindrops etc. 
}
take place, that are more or less visible to the naked eye.
In particular, for air-water systems (20 degree Celsius) the millimeter length 
scale corresponds to $Oh \sim O(10^{-2})$, where $Oh$ is the Ohnesorge number
based on the characteristic length scale of the ligaments. 
The characterization of our corrugated ligament setup using the set of adimensional
(e.g. \eqref{base_params}) numbers as discussed in the previous chapter is extended 
to describe our ensemble of ligaments, such that the exact set of parameters
correspond to a unique point in the phase space $\Phi$ of all possible combinations. 
The coalescences that intermittently occur after the initial breakup phase of 
the thread-like structure not only change the number of drops, but also impact the 
mean and dispersion of the size distribution due to the increase in the number of drops that 
are significantly larger than the width of the ligament of origin.   
This aspect of temporal dependence of the drop sizes corresponding to a particular ligament ensemble
is taken into account by specifying the time at which the statistics are recorded. 
Thus, our droplet ensembles associated with the millimeter scale ligaments can be uniquely described 
by a combination of the time $T$ and $\Phi_0$, where

\begin{align}
	\Phi_0 \equiv \left( Oh=10^{-2}, K=2\pi, \epsilon=1.0, \Lambda=50 \right). 
\end{align}

The definitions of the adimensional groups are identical to that used
in the previous chapter, hence are not repeated.
Statistical descriptions of the drop sizes are commonly carried out using
particular probability distribution functions (PDF) defined as follows 

\begin{align}
	\text{Gaussian : } \quad P\left( x ; \mu , \sigma \right) &= 
	\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \textrm{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] ,\\
	\text{Log-Normal : } \quad P\left( x ; \mu , \sigma \right) &= 
	\frac{1}{x \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \textrm{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\log x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] ,\\
	\text{Gamma : } \quad P\left( x ; n,k \right) &= 
	\frac{k^{n}}{\Gamma(n)} x^{n-1} \textrm{exp}\left(-k x\right) , 
\end{align}

where $x$ is the variable (diameter, volume etc) in question. 
The Gamma distribution can be rearranged so that $x$ represents
the variable rescaled by its mean ($n / k$), giving us 

\begin{align}
	P\left( x ; n \right) = \frac{n^{n}}{\Gamma(n)} x^{n-1} \textrm{exp}\left(-n x\right) . 
\end{align}

The diameters are normalized by the mean of the corresponding sample.  
The distributions are generated using datasets corresponding to four different sample sizes, 
including four different choices of (uniform) bin width. 
The Gaussian functions are characterized by the mean and variance of the original dataset, 
hence they are plotted alongside the histograms instead of being fitted to the bin heights.
