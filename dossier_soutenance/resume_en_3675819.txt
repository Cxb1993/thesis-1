The dynamics of liquid-gas interfacial flows play a critical role in 
several processes in nature, as well as in myriad industrial applications. 
Key elements of surface tension dominated flows such as droplets and 
bubbles constitute the fundamental mechanisms governing the exchange of heat
and mass at the ocean-atmosphere interface, conventional modes of heat
transfer and ever so importantly, the transmission of pathogens. 
One of the most fascinating features of multiphase flows is the
process of atomization, in which a liquid volume breaks into smaller
fragments via a series of topological changes of varying complexity,
ultimately resulting in the emergence of drops of various sizes.  
The present body of work is composed of numerical investigations pertaining 
to two different aspects of liquid-gas interfacial flows involving
marked density contrasts, carried out with the aid of advanced 
geometrical reconstruction based Volume-of-Fluid methods. 
The first aspect involves understanding and eventually 
suppressing certain types of instabilities that
plague standard numerical models due to the cascading 
growth of discretization errors that are
rampant at low to moderate numerical resolution. 
Finally, the second aspect of the investigation
deals with a statistical description of drop sizes, 
where the drops are generated by carrying out large
ensembles of well resolved direct numerical simulations 
of the capillary-induced breakup of randomly corrugated ligaments.
